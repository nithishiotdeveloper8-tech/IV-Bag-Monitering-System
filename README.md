## About the Project
This project is an IoT-based IV bag monitoring system.
It helps monitor the IV fluid level and alerts when the fluid is about to finish.

## Why this Project
In hospitals, nurses must continuously check IV bottles.
This system reduces manual work and improves patient safety.

## Hardware Components
- ESP32
- Load Cell / IR Sensor (for IV level detection)
- HX711 Module (if load cell used)
- OLED Display
- Buzzer
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP32 built-in)
- Servo Motor

## Features
- Real-time IV fluid monitoring
- Alert when IV fluid is low
- OLED display for status
- Wireless monitoring using Wi-Fi
- Auto Cut Off preventing back flow of blood

## Current Status
Project under development.
